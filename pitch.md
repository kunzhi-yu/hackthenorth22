# Pitch Game Plan

##Problem Statement
- How often do we text someone that you'll do something but forget later?
- When will you ever get to the bottom of your to-do list. There's so much to sort through!
- With busy lives, how can we do the things we want in life wihout spending time organizing, instead of achieveing?

#Impact
- Based off your text conversations
  - Recommends you to complete tasks
  - Recommends new tasks
- Allows you to achieve what you love and suggest things to do

##How it works
- We introduce a discord bot that
    - Suggests tasks from your conversaton
    - Allows the user to manually add tasks
    - Suggests tasks when your friends have a conversation that is similar to existing task.

##Demo
###Yu Texts a Judge (suggest tasks)
- Hand Judge someone's phone
- Prompt the judge to start any conversation, maybe about hack the north
###Mishaal shows his screenshots
- Talks to himself
- Compares to task  
##Conclusion
